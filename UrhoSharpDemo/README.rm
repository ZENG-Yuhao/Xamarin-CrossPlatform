#UrhoSharp 
is a powerful 3D Game Engine for Xamarin and .NET developers. It is similar in spirit to Appleâ€™s SceneKit and SpriteKit and include physics, navigation, networking and much more while still being cross platform.

It is a .NET binding to the Urho3D engine and allows developers to write cross platform code that can target Android, iOS, Windows and Mac with the same codebase and can render to both OpenGL and Direct3D systems.
